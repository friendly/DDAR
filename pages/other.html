<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent book, nearly encyclopedic in its coverage. I personally find it very useful and expect that many other readers will as well. The book can certainly serve as a reference. It could also serve as a supplementary text in a course on categorical data analysis that uses R for computation or, because so much statistical detail is provided, even as the main text for a course on the topic that emphasizes graphical methods. <strong><em>John Fox, McMaster University</em></strong></p>
