<p>Updates to the code examples in the book will be posted here.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><strong><code>ca</code></strong> package: There are now several enhancements for graphics for correspondence analysis (Chapter 6) in the <code>ca</code> package, v. 0.64. All examples in the book still work, but some can be simplified.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong><code>ggplot2</code></strong> changes: In the latest major release, <code>ggplot2_2.0.0</code>, calls to <code>stat_smooth(method=&quot;glm&quot;)</code> now require the <code>family</code> argument to be specified as, for example, <code>method.args = list(family = binomial)</code> rather than <code>family = binomial</code>. This affects numerous figures in Chapter 7, starting with Figure 7.2 in Example 7.3.</p></li>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent book, nearly encyclopedic in its coverage. I personally find it very useful and expect that many other readers will as well. The book can certainly serve as a reference. It could also serve as a supplementary text in a course on categorical data analysis that uses R for computation or, because so much statistical detail is provided, even as the main text for a course on the topic that emphasizes graphical methods. <strong><em>John Fox, McMaster University</em></strong></p>
