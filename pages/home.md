## Goals
**Discrete Data Analysis with R: Visualization and Modeling Techniques for Categorical and Count Data** 
presents an applied treatment of modern methods for the analysis of categorical data, both discrete response data and frequency data.

It explains how to use graphical methods for exploring data, spotting unusual features, visualizing fitted models, and presenting results.

## Audience

The book is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in the social and health sciences, epidemiology, economics, business, statistics, and biostatistics as well as researchers, methodologists, and consultants who can use the methods with their own data and analyses. It can be used for self-study, as the primary textbook for a course in categorical data analysis, or as
a supplementary text for such a course.

Along with describing the necessary statistical theory, we illustrate the practical application of the techniques to a large number of substantive problems, including:

* how to organize and manipulate categorical data, 
* conduct a statistical analysis and fit models, 
* produce informative graphs for data exploration and summary, and 
* evaluate what the graphs reveal about the data.

We assume the reader has a basic understanding of statistical concepts at least at an
intermediate undergraduate level including regression and analysis of variance.
In addition, some basic knowledge of R is assumed.

## Textbook use

This book is most directly suitable for a one-semester applied 
advanced undergraduate or graduate
course on categorical data analysis with a strong emphasis
on the use of graphical methods to understand and explain data and
results of analysis.

A detailed outline of such a course, together with lecture notes
and assignments,
is available at [Psychology 6136](http://euclid.psych.yorku.ca/www/psy6136/), using this
book as the main text.  This course also uses Agresti's *An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis*
for additional readings.


## Features

* Provides an accessible introduction to the major methods of categorical data analysis
  for data exploration, statistical testing, and statistical models.

* The emphasis throughout is on computing, visualizing, understanding, and communicating
  the results of these analyses.

* As opposed to more theoretical books, the goal here is to
  help the reader to translate theory into practical application, by providing skills and
  software tools for carrying out these methods.

* Includes many examples using real data, often treated from several perspectives.

* The book is supported directly by the R packages [**vcd**](http://cran.R-project.org/package=vcd) and [**vcdExtra**](http://cran.R-project.org/package=vcdExtra), along with numerous other R packages.

* Each chapter contains a collection of lab exercises, which work through
  applications of some of the methods presented in that chapter.  This makes the book more suitable
  for both self-study and classroom use.
