# DDAR
Development for the **Discrete Data Analysis with R** web site

## Requirements ##

PHP 5.3.10 or greater (5.4+ preferred)

Web server (e.g. Apache)

## Overview ##

This is a simple custom php/html framework. A high-level overview of how it works,
as follows:

- All site URLs are routed to the `index.php` file.
- Based on the URL's path, the routing mechanism determines which static .html files
to serve and loads it in place inside an outer html wrapper page.

## Installation ##

### Apache Web Server ###

As described above, all URLs are routed to the `index.php` file. Apache needs
a few things in place to make this happen:

1) First, you will need to enable **url rewriting** in your Apache `httpd.conf` file.

Uncomment the `rewrite_module` line as follows:

``` LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so ```

2) If you are using a ``` <VirtualHost>``` directive to define your web site, make
sure it resembles the following.

*Note*, the ``` <Directory>``` block. This allows the project to define an 
`.htaccess` file that sets up URL rewriting.

``` apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot "/path/to/your/web/directory"
	ServerName web
	<Directory "/path/to/your/web/directory">
		AllowOverride All
		Options FollowSymLinks
	</Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

If you are not using a virtual host file and are serving a single
web site, then look for the ``` apacheconf <Directory>``` block in Apache's
`httpd.conf` file. Update as follows:

``` apacheconf
AllowOverride All
Options FollowSymLinks
```

### Directory permissions ###

After installing the website, please make both the `/scripts/bootstrap`
and `/styles/bootstrap` directories writable by the web server.

## Composer package dependencies ##

### External Libraries ###

- [AltoRouter](http://altorouter.com)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [DotEnv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)


This project requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to set up
project dependencies.

### To install composer: ###

``` bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --filename=composer
```

`composer` is then executable (by php) in the current directory.

#### On project installation ####

Run the following composer commands to install the dependencies:

``` bash
composer install
composer run-script compile
```

#### On project updates ####

Run the following composer commands to update the dependencies:

``` bash
composer update
composer run-script compile
```

**Note:** `run-script compile` copies Bootstrap files to
`{styles,scripts}/bootstrap`.


## Environment variable ##

You will need to create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with
the following environment variable that defines which sub directory your
site lives in.

The following example defined the site being served from the root directory.

```
BASEPATH="/"
```

If you are serving this project from a subdirectory of the website's root,
change the above to point to the location of the subdirectory from the
web root, i.e.

```
BASEPATH="/subdirectory"
```

**Important:** Do not include a trailing slash if you are declaring a sub directory.

**Note:** If you are serving images in .html files, you will need to manually update
their paths to be relative to the sub directory.

## Site Map ##

This site is made up of the following initial files:

```
- index.php
- images/
- pages/
	- authors.html
	- book.html
	- home.html
	- materials.html
	- chapters/
		- ch01.html
		- ch01/
- scripts/
- src/
- styles/
```

## Explanation of files ##

`index.php` is the main framework entry point. Think of this as a very basic
controller in the model-view-controller pattern. `index.php` handles the setup 
of the html document, including the navigation and dynamic inclusion of the 
pages and chapters.

`images/` directory contains the global site images

`pages/` directory contains the main pages and the chapter pages. The direct
child pages  in this directory can be updated when needed. They are however
hard-coded into the nav in the index.php page. So adding any new pages will
require you to add them to the index.php navigation markup.

`pages/chapters/` directory contains the chapter files. This part of the
navigation is dynamically generated by the `index.php` file. When listing
chapters, the `index.php` script scans the `pages/chapters/` directory and 
looks for any files of the form (e.g.) `ch01.html` and then adds that to the 
chapter list in the drop down menu.

`pages/chapters/ch01/` directory is where you would store all the images and
assets for the `ch01.html` file. Ideally you would keep assets for the 
chapters contained in this way so that there would be a `ch01.html` file 
and its corresponding `ch01/` directory where its assets would live.

`scripts/` directory contains the global site scripts

`src/` directory contains any php libraries or helper functions used in the
index.php page

`styles/` directory contains a `main.css` file which is used for the global
styles. It also contains a `page.css` file where you should put page-specific
css styles, and a `chapters.css` file where you should put chapter-specific css
styles.

## Usage ##

### Main site entry point page ###

`index.php`

This page has been designed to set up the scaffolding for the site and
dynamically add nav items and page content.

**Note:** All static files in the index.php file, are served via a `urlfor` helper
function. This helper sets the basepath for any scripts or pages linked to from
the `index.php` page.

If you plan on adding any files or pages, you will need to use this helper as well.

### Chapter pages ###

`/pages/chapters/*.html`

The idea here is that you will continue to render the chapter files from
markdown using whatever process you have in place. The only caveat is that the
rendered .html files should ideally not contain `<html>`, `<head>`, or
`<body>` tags. They should only contain the markup inside the `<body>` tag.

You just need to add chapter pages to the `pages/chapters/` directory and the
site navigation will scale accordingly. Since the navigation looks to this
folder for files, it will build out all the Chapter sub pages in the navigation
automatically.

### Styles and Markup ###

You can change the markup of any of the pages to suit. Keep in mind that since
this site uses the Bootstrap framework, you should use Bootstrap markup and
classes wherever possible. Its not imperative that you do, but highly
suggested since using the Bootstrap styles will keep the content responsive.
